# Step 2 Option Descriptions
**Column_slider** 
  
  Possible values: 1 - 10
  
  Conditions: Text_Data_Source is .csv, .TextGrid, or .eaf
  
  This option is used to indicate the number of tiers or columns which the user would like to extract from the Text_Data_Source. Changing the value changes the number of options presented below the slider in the generated form. 
  
  **Column [number] Name**
  
  Possible values: any
  
  Conditions: Text_Data_Source is .csv, .TextGrid, or .eaf. Number of columns selected with Column_slider.
  
  This field specifies the name of the numbered column or tier of text. The name entered here should be exactly the same as the one used in the Text_Data_Source in order to secure successful data extraction.
  
  **Column [number] Type**
  
  Possible values: Transcription, Translation, Notes
  
  Conditions: Text_Data_Source is .csv, .TextGrid, or .eaf. Number of columns selected with Column_slider.
  
  This field specifies the type of the numbered column or tier of text, which is required for producing .flextext output files. The transcription option produces text that is interpreted by FLEx as target linguistic data, the translation option produces text that is interpreted by FLEx as a free translation of the target linguistic data. Both of these options also produce text in the other output formats. The notes option does not produce any text in the .flextext output because FLEx does not support annotation-level notes, but it does produce text in the other output formats.
  
  **Column [number] ISO 639**
  
  Possible values: any ISO 639 code.
  
  Conditions: Text_Data_Source is .csv, .TextGrid, or .eaf. Number of columns selected with Column_slider.
  
  This field specifies the language of the number column or tier of text, which is required for producing .flextext and .eaf output files. The language should be entered as [ISO 639 code](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data).
  
  
  **CSV Delimiter**
  
  Possible values: Comma, Tab, Semi-colon
  
  Conditions: Text_Data_Source or Timecode_Data_Source is .csv
  
  This dropdown menu selects the delimiter of the .csv used as input data.
